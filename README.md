# CryptoClustering

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to the Crypto Clustering challenge from Challenge 19. The goal of the challenge is to predict whether cryptocurrencies are influenced by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using Python and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Description of the Files
The project is organized into the following folders and files:
- `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: contains the codes and analysis of cryptocurrency clustering
- `Resources`: contains the data in CSV format used for the analysis

## Resources Used
- Python (including libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and others)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Xpert Learning Assistant

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the clustering analysis

Feel free to explore and modify!
